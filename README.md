# MERFISH
this repository contains that was used in GABA receptive micrglia selectively sculpt developing inhibitory circuits, Emilia Favuzzy et al.

First run groupdsmFISH.m to sum smfish images
then run Main_analysis.m to generate count and intensity matrix for repectvely MERFISH encoded genes and smFISH.
to count the smFISH transcripts for 4 genes as done in the paper, run countsmFISHHIGH.m
to recounts Gabbr1 and Gabbr2 in only the Z that are part of the microglia, run
